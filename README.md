# Distributed-CNN-Inference

- This is the implementation of Distributed Inference via Decoupled CNN Structure (DeCNN). Our work has been contributed to IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems (TPDS).
- The workflow of DeCNN includes two steps, i.e. training and inference, which are placed in "Training" and "Inference" folders separately.
- The training is based on Pytorch, implemented in Python, requires HPC system to complete the training task.
- The inference is based on Arm Compute Library, implemented in C++, in the context of low-power devices.
- Execution details can be found in related folders.
